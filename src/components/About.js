          The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its
          blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon
          and rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son
          of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright
          was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun
          shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, its edge was
          hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And√∫ril,
          Flame of the West.
