        The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade
        was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and
        rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of
        Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was
        that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone
        redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, its edge was hard and
        keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And√∫ril, Flame of the
        West.
